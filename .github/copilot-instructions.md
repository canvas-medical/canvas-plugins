## PR Title Guidelines

A title always has a prefix and a subject.

### Prefix
Make sure the title is prefixed with one of the following:

| Prefix | When to use |
|--------|-------------|
| `feat:`     | New feature |
| `fix:`      | Bug fix |
| `docs:`     | Documentation only changes |
| `style:`    | Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc) |
| `refactor:` | Code changes that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| `perf:`     | Code change that improves performance |
| `test:`     | Adding missing or correcting existing tests |
| `chore:`    | Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation, ci, etc |

### Subject

Ensure the PR title subject contains succinct description of the change.
* Use the imperative, present tense: "change", not "changed" nor "changes"
* Donâ€™t capitalize first letter
* No dot (.) at the end
