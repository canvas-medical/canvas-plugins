    **Clinical Focus:** The purpose of this value set is to represent concepts for a diagnosis of  advanced illnesses..

    **Data Element Scope:** This value set may use a model element related to Diagnosis.

    **Inclusion Criteria:** Includes concepts that represent a diagnosis of advanced illness when combined with older age and indications of frailty. Codes cover a wide range of conditions: heart failure, end stage renal disease, liver disease, emphysema, dementia and neurodegenerative disorders, metastatic and sever cancers, respiratory failure, and pulmonary fibrosis..

    **Exclusion Criteria:** Exclude concepts that indicate pregnancy, fetal, juvenile, childhood or neonatal conditions, concepts that indicate acute, temporary, or procedure-related conditions..
