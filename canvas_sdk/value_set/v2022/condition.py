    **Clinical Focus:** The purpose of this value set is to represent concepts for a diagnosis of  potential indicators of frailty.

    **Data Element Scope:** This value set may use a model element related to Diagnosis.

    **Inclusion Criteria:** Includes concepts that represent that a diagnosis of potential frailty when coupled with older age: dependence on durable medical equipment for long-term use, limitation of activities of daily living due to disability, need for assistance with care, pressure ulcers, and falls.

    **Exclusion Criteria:** Exclude concepts that indicate potential frailty when associated with pregnancy, fetal, juvenile, childhood or neonatal conditions; codes that indicate temporary need of durable medical equipment; codes that indicate accidental falls caused by another person, being pushed/shoved/collided into, falls on ice due to ice skates, falls due to impact against a baby buggy/shopping cart/wheelbarrow.
