# how do we make sure that condition_id is a valid condition for the patient?

# idea1:
# create a class attribute 'pre_validate_condition': bool
#      True: before doing any actions against the home-app instance, will first check
#            if its an active condition for that patient, and it not then logs a message
#            and doesn't do the action. can even create a cache so that we dont always
#            have to keep asking home-app for every patient
#      False: still tries to do it but will run up against whatever home-app barriers
#             we have against actions like that (if those dont already exist, then
#             definitely create them!)


# idea2:
# validator that checks that condition.patient is the same as note.patient
