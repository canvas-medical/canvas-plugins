    Synchronizes patient metadata based on appointment label changes.

    This protocol listens for appointment label events and updates a patient's
    'coverage_status' metadata field when the 'MISSING_COVERAGE' label is added or removed:

    - When MISSING_COVERAGE label is ADDED → sets coverage_status to "Missing"
    - When MISSING_COVERAGE label is REMOVED → sets coverage_status to "Active"

    This provides a centralized metadata field that reflects the patient's current
    insurance coverage status, making it easy to query and report on coverage gaps.

    The protocol is designed to work seamlessly with the appointment_coverage_label plugin,
    which manages the addition and removal of the MISSING_COVERAGE label based on actual
    insurance coverage records.
