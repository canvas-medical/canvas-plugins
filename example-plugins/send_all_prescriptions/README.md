# Canvas Send Prescriptions Plugin

A Canvas Medical SDK plugin that adds a convenient "Send Prescriptions" button to note footers, allowing healthcare providers to send all committed prescriptions in a note with a single click.

## Overview

This plugin adds an action button in the note footer that enables providers to quickly send all committed prescriptions within a note. Instead of sending prescriptions individually, providers can now send all prescriptions at once, streamlining the prescribing workflow.

## Features

- **Single-Click Prescription Sending**: Send all committed prescriptions in a note with one button click
- **Note Footer Integration**: Conveniently placed button in the note footer for easy access
- **Batch Processing**: Automatically identifies and processes all committed `PrescribeCommand` instances in the current note
- **Simple Workflow**: No configuration required - works immediately after installation

## Prerequisites

- Canvas CLI installed (`pip install canvas`)
- OAuth credentials configured for your Canvas instance

## Installation

1. Clone or download this plugin to your local development environment

2. Install the Canvas CLI if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   pip install canvas
   ```

3. Configure your Canvas CLI with OAuth credentials:
   - Register an OAuth application in your Canvas instance
   - Choose "confidential" for Client type
   - Choose "client-credentials" for Authorization grant type

4. Install the plugin to your Canvas instance:
   ```bash
   canvas install /path/to/send_all_prescriptions
   ```

## How It Works

1. **Button Display**: The plugin adds a "Send Prescriptions" button to the footer of all notes
2. **Command Detection**: When clicked, the button identifies all committed `PrescribeCommand` instances in the current note
3. **Batch Sending**: Iterates through each committed prescription and sends it to the pharmacy
4. **User Feedback**: Provides immediate feedback on the sending process

## Usage

### For Healthcare Providers

1. **Create Prescriptions**: Add prescribe commands to your note as usual
2. **Commit Prescribe Commands**
3. **Send All**: Click the "Send Prescriptions" button in the note footer

### Button Location

The "Send Prescriptions" button appears in the note footer and is only functional when there are committed prescription commands in the note.

## Development

### Project Structure

```
send_all_prescriptions/
├── CANVAS_MANIFEST.json           # Plugin configuration
├── README.md                     # This file
├── protocols/
│   └── my_protocol.py            # Main button handler
```

### Key Components

- **SendPrescriptionButtonHandler**: ActionButton subclass that handles the button click event
- **Button Configuration**: Defines button title, key, and location
- **Command Processing**: Queries and processes committed prescribe commands

### Code Structure

```python
class SendPrescriptionButtonHandler(ActionButton):
    BUTTON_TITLE = "Send Prescriptions"
    BUTTON_KEY = "SEND_ALL_PRESCRIPTIONS"
    BUTTON_LOCATION = ActionButton.ButtonLocation.NOTE_FOOTER

    def handle(self) -> list[Effect]:
        # Get note ID from context
        # Query committed prescribe commands
        # Send each prescribe
        # Return effects list
```

## Testing

To test the plugin during development:

1. **Install the plugin** in your Canvas development instance

2. **Create a test note** with prescribe commands

3. **Commit the prescribe command** to make them eligible for sending

4. **Look for the button** in the note footer

5. **Click the button** and verify prescriptions are sent


## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Button not appearing**
   - Verify the plugin is installed and enabled
   - Check that you're viewing a note (button only appears in notes)
   - Ensure the ActionButton class is properly imported

2. **Button not working when clicked**
   - Verify there are committed/signed prescribe commands in the note

3. **Some prescriptions not being sent**
   - Only committed/signed and not sent prescriptions are processed
